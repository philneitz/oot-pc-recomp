# OoT Recomp

Static recompilation of *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* (Switch 2, ARM64, update 1.1.1) into a native Windows x86-64 exe with a Vulkan renderer, built on DKB Recomp (*Donkey Kong Bananza*, Switch 2) and TotK Recomp (*Tears of the Kingdom*, Switch 1), whose names remain in parts of the code. Most of the lifter, host and Vulkan back end is TotK Recomp's; the Bananza-specific parts are the NVN 2 front end (`runtime/nvn_api_nvn2.c` and the NVN 2 paths in `runtime/gfx_shader.c`), the Ampere shader lowering (`runtime/nvn2_lower.cpp`, `runtime/third_party/eglantine/`) and the `nn::codec` movie decoder (`runtime/ov_codec.c`). Design: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md). Plan: [docs/bananza-plan.md](docs/bananza-plan.md). Shader notes: [docs/bananza-shaders.md](docs/bananza-shaders.md). Toolchain, build commands and tests: [docs/building.md](docs/building.md). Running and testing Bananza: [docs/dkb-testing.md](docs/dkb-testing.md).

## Game content boundary

This repository is public. Game data lives outside it and every derived file stays in ignored folders.

- The user's game and key paths are in `config.local.toml` (ignored). Pass the keys file path to tools; the tools read it themselves. Key values stay out of your output, logs, commands and files.
- Everything extracted or generated goes under `build/` or `generated/`.
- Every file the code generator emits carries the marker defined as `GENERATED_MARKER` in `tools/check_content.py`.
- Run `python tools/check_content.py --staged` before proposing a commit. It is the same check CI runs.

## Reusing code

`refs/` holds the upstream checkouts (`tools/fetch_refs.sh` recreates it). Read-only.

- Copy only MIT, BSD, ISC, zlib or Apache-2.0 code, keep its header, and add a row to `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- OoT Recomp is GPL-3.0-or-later as a whole (LICENSE), because it carries Eglantine's GPL Ampere lowering
  (`runtime/third_party/eglantine/`, with the owner's go-ahead). GPL-3.0-compatible code (Eden, Eglantine, yuzu and
  the like) may be copied with its header kept, a row in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and the upstream commit. Files that
  came from TotK Recomp keep their MIT terms (`LICENSE-MIT`); a fix meant for TotK Recomp itself must not use GPL code.
- `tools/vendor/` stays byte-identical to upstream; Windows changes go in `tools/extract.py`.

## Code

- Build C with MSYS2 UCRT64 Clang (`C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin`). Generated C uses GNU extensions, so `cl.exe` is out. Call Ninja from that directory by full path or put it first on PATH.
- Two Python environments: `.venv` (3.12) for the lifter and the build, `.venv-py314` for the extraction and shader scripts, which need `compression.zstd`.
- Generated C is never edited by hand: change the generator (`recomp/`).
- Every lifter change passes the differential tests against Unicorn ([docs/building.md](docs/building.md), "Checks"). After changing `recomp/jumptables.py`, `tests\jumptables_check.py` reports 0 disagreements on 1.2.1 and 1.4.3.
- `recomp/layout.py` alone decides module bases.
- Graphics bugs: [docs/maxwell.md](docs/maxwell.md) lists the Maxwell behaviour the Vulkan path must match and the TotK bugs other ports fixed.
- Bananza bugs (NVN 2, the GPU, Switch 2 services such as `nn::codec`): first read how `refs/eglantine` handles the same point. That emulator plays the game, so it is the default reference. Where it departs from the hardware on purpose (Eden's default GPU accuracy skips texture downloads on CPU reads, `RasterizerVulkan::MustFlushRegion`), say so instead of copying the shortcut.
- Comments say what the code does and why, in words that stand on their own. Cite our code by file plus function (a line number may follow as a hint) and upstream code by project, file and function: `refs/` moves, so its line numbers rot. Commit hashes belong to the attribution of copied code.

## Writing

Code, comments, docs and commit messages are in English. Commit messages are plain sentences without type prefixes.
